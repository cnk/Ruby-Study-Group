Chapter 11 exercises

First I transferred all the changes from snapshots/churn-classes.v2.rb
into our working file (keeping the svn_log mocks we created). The
tests from snapshots/churn-tests-classes.rb run

Exercises:

1. What should be moved to a formatter class? 
   One possible answer: everything else - with the exception of month_before

   Or one might argue:
        definitely these:
          header	 
   	  asterisks_for
   	  subsystem_line
       	  order_by_descending_change_count 
   
   I am not so sure about churn_line_to_int.  For one thing, we
   shouldn't be reextracting that count from the subssystem line. The
   loop that creates subsystem_lines shouldn't return a formatted
   line, it should return the subsystem name and the change count and
   the formatter should do what it likes with it. (That has been
   bugging me for a week or two.)

2. I copied snapshots/churn-tests-classes.rb into churn-tests.rb as
   the starting point for this exercise. Then moved all the remaining
   tests except for test_month_before_is_28_days out of the ChurnTests
   class into a new FormatterTests class. I added a setup method that
   created a formatter instance which I then used in all the tests.

3. Moved all the remaining methods (except month_before) into a new
   Formatter class and now the tests pass. Now we need to adjust the
   main method of the script accordingly.
