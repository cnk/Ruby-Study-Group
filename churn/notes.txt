Chapter 11 exercises

First I transferred all the changes from snapshots/churn-classes.v2.rb
into our working file (keeping the svn_log mocks we created). The
tests from snapshots/churn-tests-classes.rb run

Exercises:

1. What should be moved to a formatter class? 
   One possible answer: everything else - with the exception of month_before

   Or one might argue:
        definitely these:
          header	 
   	  asterisks_for
   	  subsystem_line
       	  order_by_descending_change_count 
   
   I am not so sure about churn_line_to_int.  For one thing, we
   shouldn't be reextracting that count from the subssystem line. The
   loop that creates subsystem_lines shouldn't return a formatted
   line, it should return the subsystem name and the change count and
   the formatter should do what it likes with it. (That has been
   bugging me for a week or two.)

2. I copied snapshots/churn-tests-classes.rb into churn-tests.rb as
   the starting point for this exercise. Then moved all the remaining
   tests except for test_month_before_is_28_days out of the ChurnTests
   class into a new FormatterTests class. I added a setup method that
   created a formatter instance which I then used in all the tests.

3. Moved all the remaining methods (except month_before) into a new
   Formatter class and now the tests pass. Now we need to adjust the
   main method of the script accordingly.

4. It was really easy to make the two changes shown in exercise 4 -
   first the very simple changes to use a formatter class - and then
   the change to move the line collecting into the formatter
   class. But I am having a really hard time writing sensible tests
   for the churn code as shown on p 122. I think mostly because I
   fundamentally want to change how the formatter gets, stores, and
   prints out data. So I don't want to write a test that tests the
   *implimentation* of use_subsystem_with_change_count because I want
   to change the content of @subsystem_lines.
